            At Smart Mountain, we're on a mission to revolutionize how we value
            and finance nature-based solutions to climate change. We focus on
            mangrove ecosystems, which play a critical role in carbon
            sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity preservation, and
            regenerating social and environmental impact to benefit communities.{" "}

            <p className="pt-3 text-lg">
              Despite their immense value, mangrove restoration projects
              struggle to attract capital from traditional financial systems.
              These projects are often overlooked due to their high-risk profile
              and returns, which are difficult to quantify using conventional
              financial approaches. As a result, climate industries remain
              underdeveloped and isolated, leaving us ill-equipped to face the
              growing climate emergency.

              instruments to derisk a validated environmental credit market.
